Description: Efficient tools for transport modeling, specifically route enumeration 
    and traffic assignment tasks. The package implement the path-sized logit model for 
    traffic assignment, a very efficient route enumeration algorithm, and provides 
    powerful utilities for network processing. The user is expected to provide a 
    transport network graph (either a graph data frame or a collection of LINESTRING
    geometries representing a graph) and an OD-matrix with trade/traffic flows.
