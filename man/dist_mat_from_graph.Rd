\title{Compute Distance Matrix from Graph}
\usage{
dist_mat_from_graph(graph_df, directed = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph_df}{A data frame representing a graph with columns:
\code{from}, \code{to}, and \code{cost}.}

\item{directed}{Logical (default: FALSE). If TRUE, treats the graph as directed;
if FALSE, treats it as undirected.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{get_distance_matrix}.}

\item{algorithm}{Character string (default: "mch"). Algorithm to use for distance
computation. Options include "mch" (many-to-many with contraction hierarchies),
"dijkstra", "bi", etc. See \code{cppRouting::get_distance_matrix} for details.}
}
\value{
A matrix of distances between all node pairs, where rows and columns
  correspond to node IDs. The matrix contains the shortest path distances
  (based on the \code{cost} column) between all pairs of nodes.
}
\description{
Compute a distance matrix for all node pairs in a graph using cppRouting.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
  \item Converts the graph data frame to a cppRouting graph object
  \item Contracts the graph for efficient distance computation
  \item Computes the distance matrix for all node pairs using the specified algorithm
}
The graph is contracted using \code{cpp_contract} to optimize distance calculations,
which is particularly efficient for repeated queries.
